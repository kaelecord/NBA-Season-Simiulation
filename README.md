# NBA-Season-Simiulation
Simulation of the 2020-2021 NBA Season

The goal of my project was to write a program that would simulate a whole season of NBA games. The two datasets required to run this program are the following: a schedule dataset containing all games played during the regular season and a dataset containing player data (necessary variables: name, team, and PPG).![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99698416/153975684-ec4bf1d6-9645-4bab-94b7-87422358cd5f.png)
